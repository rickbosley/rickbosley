## Why, Hello! üëã

### ‚ö°About Me
</div>
Rick is from a small town in Western Maryland...<em>way out where most folks forget Maryland still exists</em>. He spent over nine years in the US Navy :anchor: as a machinist's mate on a submarine. 
Rick currently resides outside York, PA with his family, and works as Nuclear Energy professional in the commercial nuclear power industry.

<p>
While a full-time student, Rick leads a team of about 20 'technical writers' who develop instructions for performing power plant maintenance, modifications, and testing. He hopes to use his learning to pivot into different, and more technologically-advanced, roles following graduation. Projected graduation is December 2026 with a BS in Human Systems Engineering.
